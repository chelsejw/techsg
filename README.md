# Scrappy (TBC)
Other names: Billboard ___?  

### What is this project about?
- Born out of curiousity to know the stacks/languages most in demand in the current tech landscape in Singapore.
- This app gets data from a local job website and returns job titles, company names and keywords (e.g. Python, JavaScript, C++)
- Users should be able to view job listings by tech (to see what jobs they are more suitable for), or view tech mentioned by company (if they want to see their suitability for a particular company).
- Users should be able to see top technologies mentioned across all jobs or within a company.

## Technologies Used
- Django (Python) backend 
- React front-end 

### Tasks
- ~Create web scr*per to get data from website~
- ~Add data to database~
- ~Display data in table form with a React front-end~
- ~Paginate results~
- Filter jobs by tech mentioned
- Filter jobs by company
- Display Top 5 mentioned
- ~~Add posting date to information parsed~~ - __not implementing – won't be able to calculate date posted for listings more than 30 days old as Ind**d uses the "xx days ago" instead of solid dates, and after 30 days it just says "30+ days ago"__
- ~~Improve keyword matching - use Regex to differentiate between Java vs Javascript, C vs C# vs C++,Go vs GoLang, etc~~. 

### Extras Tasks
- A Billboard-style stylistic Top 5 Chart for Frontend/Backend technologies
- Graphs for popularity
